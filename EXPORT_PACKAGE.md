## Integration Steps

### Step 1: Copy Backend Files
1. Copy `shared/schema.ts` to your project's shared directory
2. Copy `server/storage.ts` - integrate with your existing storage system
3. Copy API routes from `server/routes.ts` to your main routes file

### Step 2: Copy Frontend Files
1. Copy all files from `client/src/components/onboarding/` to your components directory
2. Copy `client/src/pages/onboarding.tsx` to your pages directory
3. Copy `client/src/lib/firebase.ts` to your lib directory

### Step 3: Update Routing
Add to your main App.tsx:
```tsx
import OnboardingPage from "@/pages/onboarding";

// In your router:
<Route path="/onboarding" component={OnboardingPage} />
<Route path="/" component={OnboardingPage} /> // or redirect to onboarding
```

### Step 4: Merge Styling
1. Copy custom CSS variables from `client/src/index.css`
2. Ensure your Tailwind config includes the custom colors
